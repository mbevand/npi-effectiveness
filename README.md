Author: Marc Bevand

This repository is a list—as exhaustive as possible—of all peer-reviewed &
published research articles that evaluate the effectiveness of
nonpharmaceutical interventions, specifically lockdowns on COVID-19.

Papers finding NPIs effective outnumber, by 8 to 1, those finding them ineffective.

## Criteria for inclusion in the list

1. Be a **research article** (data, methods, results). Commentaries, opinion pieces, etc, do not qualify
2. Be **peer-reviewed & published** among the 26,000 titles in Scopus
3. Be **explicit**. No secondhand interpretation of figures or data tables. The
  authors must explicitly state in the text whether their results suggest NPIs
  are effective or not. Their exact words have been peer-reviewed & published. A
  secondhand interpretation has not.

## List of research articles

The list is included below, and is also available in JSON format: [articles.json](articles.json)

There are 75 research articles
* 60 papers find NPIs are generally effective (:heavy_check_mark:)

Vaccines being available "is not considered in the model" therefore it is inconclusive how the model applies to the real-world.
